Introduction 
According to the given case scenario, a new start-up company wants to build apps for Android and IOS systems. As an IT consultancy firm, we should give the right advices how to start it and how to make this business lucky in terms of technology. Firstly, we should give attention to the tools which are hardware or configuration of computers and servers. Secondly, there are 5 aspects which can make this business work on its way: designing and prototyping, process of development, testing process and project management. Without these branches, IT companies cannot make anything efficient. So, as IT consultants, we will give what are the most efficient tools, what can be recommendations and advice, which means can most fit to this kind of business overall, and should give conclusion.
Review of hardware/software and solutions
Review of Hardware
One of the most important aspects of IT companies is computers and their configurations or hardware parts. And these companies should make sure that they have the right hardware tools and packs. First of all, we should consider that this new company makes Android and IOS mobile apps, and for that it is better for buying Macbook Air or Macbook Pro computers. Because on Windows, it’s hard to create IOS apps and we cannot make the right framework to do on Windows. Macbook Air and Macbook Pro can work for both developmental processes. When it comes to configuration of these computers, processors should be 2.0GHz quad-core 7/8th generation Intel Core i5/i7, random access memory should be at least 8GB, they can contain SSD (solid-state drive) with 128GB storage or 256GB storage. Graphics are Intel UHD or GeForce graphics. Also, for designing purposes, it will be fine if they have retina displays. When it comes to servers, today, most of companies prefer cloud servers. Because they are safer and efficient in most aspects rather than other server types. For example, Amazon Web Servers or Google App Engine webservers are two great examples. Or this new company can build its own webserver like locally. So, in the upcoming table clear review is given.
Review of Software
Software is a basic part of any app. In this part, software reviews will be given accordingly.
Firstly, project management is one of the significant aspects of application building. And project managers should divide tasks efficiently and manage the team. When it comes to software of project management, Trello, GitHub, Jira and Basecamp can be great solutions. They improve time management, give opportunities to share files, images or other crucial parts of the given job. With these tools, managers can divide tasks among team members, control their jobs, plan sprints, describe jobs, job instructions and make comments to jobs. With these tools, project management process can be done easily and accurate.
Secondly, designing is also one big part of every app making process. Great designs work for both UI (user interface) of apps and for marketing purposes also. In order to achieve great designs, today, most of designers prefer Adobe Xd or Adobe Photoshop, Sketch, InVision products. These products have both vector and pixel graphics. They have built-in templates, artboards and other great tools. They have also cost benefits as well. 
Thirdly, the core processes of making apps is development process. Developers or software engineers use that kind of tools. Developer use two kind of mobile development tools which are cross platform mobile app making tools and native mobile app building tools. Native tools are used only for one type of platform. For example, Xcode is used for IOS app making process. Or Android studio is used for Android app making process. Cross-platform tools are used for working for both systems. Builfire.js, Ionic are nice practices. The both types of tools create good comfortability for users or programmers. For example, Xcode provides render functions for UI codes, Android Studio provides code shortcuts, and have functions as drag and drop. So, Android studio and Xcode for native app making tools, and Ionic and Buildfire.js are nice solutions for this company.
Fourthly, apps may have bugs. For this situation, we need tools for testing. These tools are used to test mobile applications on various platforms, to create test cases, to ensure smooth application implementation, to create functional, regression and usability tests. And they show what is what, whether an application has any bugs and etc. For instance, TestingWhiz, Selendroid, Testcomplete and HPEUF are very perfect tools for testing. Selendroid is a great tool which makes comfortable testing, can make integrations as a node. TestingWhiz is also a nice tool which can offer browser testing conditions, integration of SMTP, and also, has integration with Jira and that kind of tools which can ease bug tracking. They use frameworks for testing for both IOS and Android OS.
Servers 
Servers can be divided into 3 parts as a service. The first one is infrastructure as a service or IaaS. One of IaaS solutions is Amazon Web Services known as AWS. It provides on-demand cloud computing solutions and platforms for little businesses, individuals, for huge IT businesses. It has a basis called pay-as-you-go. AWS services for clients in over 70 sections. It has storage section, networking section, deployment section, management, analytical tools in order to have better internet, database qualities. The second one is platform as a service or PaaS. Google App Engine is one great tool in this section. Google App Engine gives comfortable working environment, and with this it is easy to use cloud services. It also provides hosting servers, networking databases, tools used to make machine learning. The third one is the service as known as software as a service. Google Apps, Dropbox, Bigcommerce are good examples of this kind of services.

Justifications and Recommendations
As an IT consultancy firm, we give recommendations. First of all, computers and servers. As mentioned above, most developers prefer Macbook Pro. If we compare two options which were written above, Macbook Pro has 2.4GHz quad-core 7/8/9th-generation Intel Core i5/i7 processor, 8GB Ram, 4k-display, 2 TB hard drive, 256 GB SSD, new design, low weight. Macbook Air has 2.0GHz quad-core 7/8th-generation Intel Core i5/i7 processor, 8GB RAM configurable up to 32GB, 512 GB hard drive, 128 SSD, low weight. According price category, it is easy to show the difference, because Macbook Pro has $200 higher than Macbook Air. But Macbook Pro has some other beneficial aspects for designing and developing purposes.
For project management purposes, Trello and GitHub can be very possible solutions. They both have clear collaboration environment, job dividing process, comment sections. GitHub is purely free for public projects, and private projects have fees starting from $7/per person. Trello is free also for limited usage, business class is $9.99/per year and it sounds good.  Zen function of GitHub is great for most users and programmers. Also, GitHub supports around 200 languages, has back-up environment, easy problem catching features. But for security reasons, it has some defects and storage resources can be easily hacked. Trello has features for sharing files, images and mostly tasks can be divided with easy. And when tasks are done or when someone puts a comment, it notifies about them. To sum up, the company can use both of them simultaneously.  
For design making tools, Adobe Xd and Adobe Photoshop are two most practical tools. Adobe Xs is free for limited usage, has premium which has a fee $9.99 for per year. Adobe Photoshop has a 20.99-dollar fee per person and provides with limitless prototypes. Both of them work on both operation systems. Adobe Photoshop is used for pixel graphics and Adobe Xd is used for vector graphics and the difference of them is also that. But both two have their own specific functions for making qualified designs. So, two of them can be best solutions.
For development process tools, native tools are best ones according to most developers. Xcode is for IOS development. It is free for Apple customers, and it uses Swift language and packs. Also, it is with great editor, layout, in-depth testing, declarative syntax, design tools, live mode. Android studio is for Android development. One of the best things about Android studio is that it can be installed on Mac computers also. And it is an open source tool which is that everyone can use. Clear aspects are flexible build design, real time profilers, intelligent code editor, fast emulator, APK analyzer. In conclusion, both can be used for making apps in both fields.
Another aspect of every project is app testing. Testers can use lots of tools to identify if a project has bugs or less-attention-paid parts. One recommendation is TestingWhiz. Although it has a 25-dollar fee, it can be used for both systems. And it is faster also.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we gave here best practices and solutions for the new company. In all aspects, they can use the given products and they will make this business to a big and punctual company.
